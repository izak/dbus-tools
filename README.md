# Introduction

This is dbus-tools, a set of tools to have more fun with DBus. This is a
source import -- and hopefully continuation -- of the original project at
[google code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/dbus-tools/source/default/source),
which was shut down in 2016.

# Installation
 - copy dbus somewhere in your $PATH
 - copy _dbus in /usr/share/zsh/site-functions if you want ZSH completion for
dbus-cli. You can also add it somewhere into your $fpath, for example put it in
$HOME/.config/zsh/comp/_dbus and add fpath=(${HOME}/.config/zsh/rc/comp $fpath)
at the top of your .zshrc

# TODO
 * Debianisation
